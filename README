This is our Ruby+Sinatra+Redis assignment, which is to implement a 
basic Internet poll creation site with the aforementioned tools.

The site allows poll creation (with foreground, background, and text 
color selection, and dynamic addition of both questions and answers),
poll taking, and the display of poll results.

A sidebar exists on all pages to allow a poll key to be entered 
directly for either poll taking or poll results.

The code is already prepared to be deployed on Heroku as well, and 
has already been deployed at:
